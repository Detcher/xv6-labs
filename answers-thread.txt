No concurrency with 1 thread when accessing the shared hash table;
When 2 threads(A && B) both execute to the place between "35: e->next = n;" and "36: *p = e;", and A keeps executing,
    making table[i] points to its new entry; 
    But when B executes next, it makes table[i] pointing to its new entry,
    thus losing new entry from A.
